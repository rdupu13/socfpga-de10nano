# Final project proposal
This file is the template for your final project proposal. Please update this file with your proposal details (delete these first two sentences, please :slightly_smiling_face:)

## Hardware/software proposal 1
Describe one of the hardware and software proposals. The hardware and software must work together. Include a brief description of the hardware/software interface (e.g., what sort of registers will you create/use, etc.)

## Hardware/software proposal 2
Describe the other hardware and software proposal. The hardware and software must work together. Include a brief description of the hardware/software interface (e.g., what sort of registers will you create/use, etc.)

## Extra credit
Define any extra credit proposals here.

## Division of labor
Briefly describe who will be working on what. For extra credit tasks and any software above the driver level, it is okay for both group members to work on a single piece, so long as the division of labor and responsibilities are clear.
